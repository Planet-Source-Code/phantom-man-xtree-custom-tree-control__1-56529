### Description

A First On PSC (I Think)

An Attempt At A Fully Owner Drawn Treeview Control.

Created To Simulate The Outlook 2003 Treeview Control.

Each Node Can Have It's Own Properties: ie: Fontcolor,Itemdata etc.

Lots Of Properties ie: Gradient Select, Background picture, Background Gradient(Without Picture),Full Row Select, Icons, No Horizontal Scrollbar, XP Theme Support To Many To Mention.

Although This Uses A Collection Based Methodoligy I Think It works Quite Good.

Drawing Is Fast and Flicker Free.

I Have Tested This on Windows XP and Works Really Well Upto 3000 Nodes.

As This Is The First Relase Please Don't Be To Harsh As I Know There Are Many Things Still Missing.

As Always Feedback And Constructive Critisim is Always Welcome.

Kind Regards

Gary
